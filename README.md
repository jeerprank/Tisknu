Code Explanation - GitHub README This code is a Python script that utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for printing files. The script allows the user to select a file and choose a printer from a dropdown menu to initiate the printing process. It also includes a button that can be used to change the GUI theme.  Prerequisites Before running this code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:  Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Required Libraries: Install the required libraries by running the following command: Copy code pip install tkinter ttkthemes pywin32 pillow Code Explanation Let's go through the code section by section to understand its functionality.  python Copy code import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk from tkinter import filedialog from ttkthemes import ThemedStyle from win32 import win32api from win32 import win32print from PIL import Image, ImageTk The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. tkinter is imported as tk for creating the GUI components, while ttk is imported separately for the themed button and combobox. filedialog is imported from tkinter to provide a file selection dialog. ThemedStyle is imported from ttkthemes to enable theme customization. win32api and win32print are imported from win32 for printer-related functionality. Image and ImageTk are imported from PIL (Pillow) to handle images in the GUI.  python Copy code root = tk.Tk() root.withdraw() Here, a new Tk object is created, but its main window is immediately withdrawn (hidden) using the withdraw() method. This allows the script to create additional windows later without showing the main window.  python Copy code style = ThemedStyle(root) icon_path = r"C:\Users\Jeer\Desktop\codin\Tiskačka\build\ico-8.png" icon = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(icon_path)) root.iconphoto(True, icon) A ThemedStyle object is created, associated with the root window. This enables theme customization for the GUI components. An icon image is loaded from the specified path using Image.open() and converted into an ImageTk.PhotoImage object. The icon is then set as the application icon using root.iconphoto().  python Copy code style.theme_use("equilux") style.configure("TCombobox", fieldbackground="white", background="white") style.configure("TButton", foreground="white") style.configure(".", font=("Gantari SemiBold", 10)) The GUI theme is set to "equilux" using style.theme_use(). This can be customized to any other theme supported by ttkthemes. Next, various styles are configured using style.configure(). The combobox (TCombobox) and button (TButton) are customized to have a white background and white foreground (text color). The font for all components is set to "Gantari SemiBold" with a size of 10.  python Copy code def change_theme():     if style.theme_use() == "equilux":         style.theme_use("default")     else:         style.theme_use("equilux") This function is triggered when the "Change theme!" button is clicked. It checks the currently used theme and toggles between "equilux" and "default" themes using style.theme_use().  python Copy code def print_files(file_path):     printers = win32print.EnumPrinters(2)     printer_names = [printer[2] for printer in printers]      pt = tk.Toplevel()     pt.geometry("320x180")     pt.title("Tisknu")      font_style = ("Gantari SemiBold", 12)     LABEL = tk.Label(pt, text="Vyber tiskárnu", fg="black", font=font_style)     LABEL.pack()      PRCOMBO = ttk.Combobox(pt, width=35, values=printer_names, style="TCombobox", font=font_style)     PRCOMBO.pack()      style.configure("Custom.Horizontal.TProgressbar", troughcolor="white", background="white")     PROGRESS_BAR = ttk.Progressbar(pt, orient="horizontal", length=200, mode="indeterminate", style="Custom.Horizontal.TProgressbar")     PROGRESS_BAR.pack(pady=10)      BUTTON = ttk.Button(pt, text="Tisknout", command=lambda: print_selected_file(file_path, PRCOMBO.get(), PROGRESS_BAR), style="TButton")     BUTTON.pack() This function creates a new top-level window (Toplevel) for selecting a printer and initiating the printing process. It takes a file_path argument but doesn't use it directly (will be explained later). First, it retrieves the list of available printers using win32print.EnumPrinters(2) and extracts the printer names from the obtained data. Then, a new top-level window is created with a fixed size of 320x180 and titled "Tisknu" (Czech for "Printing").  Inside the window, a label (LABEL) is created to prompt the user to select a printer. A combobox (PRCOMBO) is created using ttk.Combobox, which allows the user to choose a printer from the available options. The combobox is configured with a width of 35, using the previously configured combobox style and font.  A custom progress bar style (Custom.Horizontal.TProgressbar) is defined using style.configure(). The progress bar (PROGRESS_BAR) is then created with a length of 200, an indeterminate mode, and the custom style. It is also configured to have a white background and white progress trough.  A button (BUTTON) is created with the text "Tisknout" (Czech for "Print") and a command that calls the print_selected_file() function, passing the file_path, selected printer name, and progress bar as arguments. The button is styled using the previously configured button style.  python Copy code def print_selected_file(file_path, printer_name, progress_bar):     root = tk.Tk()     root.withdraw()     file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()     with open(file_path, 'r') as f:         lines = f.readlines()         total_lines = len(lines)         progress_bar.configure(maximum=total_lines)          for index, line in enumerate(lines):             file_name, directory = line.strip().split(':')             win32api.ShellExecute(0, "print", directory, '/{}'.format(printer_name), ".", 0)             progress_bar.step()             progress_bar.update()      progress_bar.stop() This function is responsible for printing the selected file. It creates a new Tk object and immediately hides its main window. Then, it opens a file selection dialog using filedialog.askopenfilename() to allow the user to choose a file to print. The selected file path is stored in the file_path variable.  The selected file is opened and read line by line. The total number of lines is determined using len(lines). The progress bar's maximum value is set accordingly using progress_bar.configure().  Inside the loop, each line is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace and split into file_name and directory using the colon (':') delimiter. win32api.ShellExecute() is called to initiate the printing of the specified directory with the selected printer_name.  After each iteration, the progress bar is updated using progress_bar.step() and progress_bar.update(). Finally, when the loop is complete, the progress bar is stopped using progress_bar.stop().  python Copy code print_files('file.txt')  button = ttk.Button(root, text="Change theme!", command=change_theme) button.pack()  root.mainloop() The print_files() function is called with the argument 'file.txt', which represents the path of the file to be printed.  A button (button) is created using ttk.Button and added to the root window. It has the text "Change theme!" and triggers the change_theme() function when clicked.  Finally, the main event loop is started using root.mainloop(), which waits for user interactions and keeps the GUI running until the user closes the windows or exits the program.  Conclusion This code demonstrates how to create a GUI using tkinter and perform file printing operations using win32print. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a printer and initiating the printing process. The code also includes the option to change the GUI theme and supports theme customization.  Remember to adjust the file paths and customize the font styles and themes according to your needs.
